***Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning***
**Task Objective**

Cluster customers based on their spending habits and propose marketing strategies tailored to each segment.

**Your Approach**

Data Preprocessing: Loaded the Mall Customers dataset, checked for missing values, and selected Annual Income and Spending Score as key features. Scaled the features for K-Means clustering.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Analyzed distributions of Age, Gender, Income, and Spending Score; visualized relationships with plots.

K-Means Clustering: Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and segmented customers.

**Visualization:** 
Applied PCA and t-SNE to visualize clusters in 2D.

Insights: Interpreted cluster characteristics and proposed marketing strategies for each segment.

**Results and Findings**

Customers were grouped into 5 clusters.

Cluster Insights & Marketing Strategies:

High Income, High Spending → VIP products, loyalty programs

High Income, Low Spending → Personalized offers, value deals

Low Income, High Spending → Promotions, trendy seasonal products

Low Income, Low Spending → Affordable bundles, discounts, loyalty rewards

Visualizations clearly show cluster separation and customer distribution patterns.
